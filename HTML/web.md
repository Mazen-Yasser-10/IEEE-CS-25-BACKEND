## How the web works?


#### if the URL contains a domain name, the browser first connects to a domain name server and retrieves the corresponding IP address for the web server.

#### The web browser connects to the web server and sends an HTTP request (via the protocol stack) for the desired web page.

#### The web server receives the request and checks for the desired page. If the page exists, the web server sends it. If the server cannot find the requested page, it will send an HTTP 404 error message. (404 means 'Page Not Found' as anyone who has surfed the web probably knows.)

## HTTP VS HTTPS


#### Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a protocol or set of communication rules for establishing communication between a client and a server. When you visit a website, your browser sends an HTTP request to the web server, which responds with an HTTP response. The web server and browser exchange data in plain text. In short, HTTP is the underlying technology that supports network communications. Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is a more secure version or extension of HTTP, as its name suggests. In HTTPS, the browser and server establish a secure, encrypted connection before data is transferred.

## Web servers


#### At a basic level, a web server stores and delivers websites and web applications. Web servers are composed of hardware and software that work together to facilitate the exchange of data.

## DNS


#### The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.

#### Each device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address which other machines use to find the device. DNS servers eliminate the need for humans to memorize IP addresses such as 192.168.1.1 (in IPv4), or more complex newer alphanumeric IP addresses such as 2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2 (in IPv6).
