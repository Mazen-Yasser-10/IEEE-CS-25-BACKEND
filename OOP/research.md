## who invent OOP and why


#### Alan Kay coined the term “object oriented programming” at grad school in 1966 or 1967. The big idea was to use encapsulated mini-computers in software which communicated via message passing rather than direct data sharing — to stop breaking down programs into separate “data structures” and “procedures”.

## Encapsulation & Abstraction


#### Encapsultion is the concept of binding data and methods and preventing it from unauthorized access. It wraps up data and functions under a single unit. Another way to think about encapsulation is, that it is a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield.

#### Data Abstraction is the property by virtue of which only the essential details are displayed to the user. The trivial or the non-essential units are not displayed to the user. Ex: A car is viewed as a car rather than its individual components. Data Abstraction may also be defined as the process of identifying only the required characteristics of an object ignoring the irrelevant details.

## Inheritance


#### Inheritance in OOP = When a class derives from another class.

#### The child class will inherit all the public and protected properties and methods from the parent class. In addition, it can have its own properties and methods.

## PHP Interfaces & Polymorphism


#### Interfaces allow you to specify what methods a class should implement.

#### Interfaces make it easy to use a variety of different classes in the same way. When one or more classes use the same interface, it is referred to as "polymorphism".

## PHP Traits


#### PHP only supports single inheritance: a child class can inherit only from one single parent.

#### So, what if a class needs to inherit multiple behaviors? OOP traits solve this problem.

#### Traits are used to declare methods that can be used in multiple classes. Traits can have methods and abstract methods that can be used in multiple classes, and the methods can have any access modifier (public, private, or protected).
